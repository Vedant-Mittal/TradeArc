Redesign the two product pages for TradeArk's B2B export portfolio site:

Fox Nut (Makhana)

Cork HoReCa Décor

These pages are currently not well optimized and overuse the yellow in the color palette. The visual hierarchy, spacing, contrast, and content layout also need improvement.

🔎 Key Issues to Fix
1. Color Palette Misuse

Too much use of flat yellow/saffron makes the page visually loud and hard to scan.

Maintain brand palette (saffron, deep brown, cream) but use yellow as an accent, not background.

Base the primary background on off-white/cream with brown or saffron highlights.

2. Visual Hierarchy & Layout

Overcrowded sections with poor spacing and inconsistent card sizes.

Icons and section headers don't guide the user through content logically.

Hero section lacks impact — consider an image + overlay gradient instead of yellow block.

3. Call-to-Actions (CTAs)

CTAs (like “Download Brochure,” “Request Mockup”) are too repetitive and cluttered.

Use one main CTA per section and de-emphasize secondary ones.

Button hover states and contrast need refinement for readability.

4. Responsiveness & Structure

Margins/paddings are inconsistent — too tight on mobile and too wide in some desktop sections.

Image blocks (icons, product images) are poorly aligned and not informative enough.

Reuse consistent card structure and layout across both product pages for clean UX.

🎨 Design Goals
✅ Use of Brand Colors

Cream / off-white as primary background

Deep brown for headings, CTA buttons, footer

Saffron / yellow as accent only (icons, buttons, highlights)

Ensure good contrast and consistent font usage (Montserrat + Lora or similar)

✅ Section Flow (for Both Pages)

Hero Section

Image background with dark gradient overlay (not full saffron fill)

Headline: white or cream text

Two CTA buttons: “Request Quote” and “Download Brochure / Catalog”

Intro Section

Clean 2-column: Left = icon/image; Right = short informative intro

Use icons in a subtle saffron tone or brown line style

Product Types

Uniform cards (equal height, white cards on cream background)

Use icons or thumbnails

Include brief 2–3 line descriptions and MOQ if relevant

Key Benefits

Use 3–4 icons in a row with brief copy under each

Example: High Protein, Custom Packaging, Shelf Life, Certified

Use Cases

Grid layout: 2 per row on desktop, 1 per row on mobile

Real use case visuals or icon-based grid (with proper spacing)

Packaging / Customization Options

Clearly structured comparison layout or tabs

Icons or minimal mockup illustrations

Sustainability Notes (for cork)

Small section with green-themed icons, clean 2-row layout

CTA Footer

Dark brown background

Bold title (“Ready to Partner with Us?” / “Ready to Transform Your Space?”)

Only 2 buttons: “Request a Quote” & “Download PDF”

🧩 Additional Suggestions
Use high-quality lifestyle or mockup images in hero or mid-page

Animate testimonial or certification icons on scroll (if reused in future)

Add breadcrumbs for SEO & navigation clarity

Add anchor links or tabs to jump to packaging, specs, use cases (optional)
